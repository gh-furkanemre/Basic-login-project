--About Me--
I'm currently learning C++, and this project serves as my practice. I would be happy if someone finds my project useful or enjoyable.


--Basic Login project--
A user interface that only asks for a username and password and operates with a basic algorithm. When you enter your username and password, another window opens. If you don't have an account, you can register locally.


--Running the Application--
Open the "LoginGUI.sln" folder. Run it in either debug or release mode.


--Making Changes--
For form designs, you can check '.h' extension files, while '.cpp' files handle form methods and can be modified.


--Images--
The images have been downloaded randomly, with no commercial intent. If someone wishes to benefit from my project, they assume responsibility. If the image owner wishes to have it removed, this project will be taken down, provided they can confirm their ownership of the image.


--Target Platform--
Windows


--Programming Language--
C++, C++ CLI (.NET)


--License--
This project does not have a specific license.
